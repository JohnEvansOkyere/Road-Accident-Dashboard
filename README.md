# Road-Accident-Dashboard
This analysis aims to spotlight the causes and number of casualties resulting from road accidents in the United States during the years 2021 and 2022, specifically focusing on urban areas. This endeavor serves to support road safety campaigns targeted at mitigating road accidents.

The tool utilized for this analysis and visualization is an Excel spreadsheet. By employing Excel, I undertook data cleaning procedures, eliminating null values and duplicate entries. Additionally, I segmented the dates into day, month, and year columns for enhanced analysis.

Following data cleansing, I leveraged pivot tables to dissect the data and extract pertinent insights. Furthermore, I utilized charts to visually represent these insights, thereby imbuing them with greater clarity and meaning.

The data uncovered various factors contributing to road accidents, including the causes of casualties, the severity of incidents, road types, urban/rural distinctions, weather conditions, car types, light conditions, and road surface quality. Each of these factors plays a distinct role in shaping the landscape of road accidents.

This narrative underscores the imperative of data-driven approaches in comprehending and addressing road safety challenges. By delving into key factors and trends, we equip ourselves with the knowledge needed to develop targeted interventions aimed at reducing the frequency and severity of road accidents in urban settings.





There were a total of 13461 casualties in the reported timeframe. Of these casualties, the vast majority (87%) were slight casualties (11687), with serious casualties accounting for 12% (1623) and fatal casualties making up only 1% (1513).
Car accidents were the most common type of accident, accounting for 80% (10763) of casualties. There were also pedestrian casualties (though the data doesn’t show how many).
Most accidents (6508) occurred on single carriageways, followed by dual carriageways (3721) and roundabouts (9088).
Dry surfaces were far more common than wet surfaces when accidents occurred (94924 vs 38446).
Most accidents occurred in daylight (37737) compared to dark conditions (27344).
Urban areas had a higher number of casualties (37737) than rural areas (27344).
The number of casualties appears to have increased year-over-year according to the graph though specific figures aren't shown.
Here’s a possible story based on this data:

There has been a significant increase in road accidents over the past year. While the majority of accidents result in slight casualties, there is still a concerning number of serious and fatal accidents.  Cars are the most common vehicle involved in accidents, and most accidents occur on single carriageways in dry conditions and during daylight hours.  Urban areas are experiencing a higher number of accidents than rural areas.

Develop strategies to reduce accidents, such as improving road safety or promoting defensive driving campaigns.
Allocate resources to areas where they are most needed.
Additional insights (with some speculation):

The data doesn't show any information on speeding or distracted driving, which are two common causes of accidents. It would be helpful to see if there has been an increase in these behaviors to determine if they are contributing to the rise in accidents.
